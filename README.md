## 🏆 Project Description

NexusGuard is a proactive **AI Stadium Operations Copilot** designed for the **Google Prompt Wars Virtual Challenge** (Focusing on the FIFA World Cup 2026). 

**The Problem:** Managing a 80,000+ seat stadium involves analyzing thousands of data points—crowd density, medical emergencies, staff positioning, and fan queries. Traditional dashboards are reactive, forcing operators to manually parse data to find issues.

**The Solution:** NexusGuard flips the paradigm. Instead of humans monitoring dashboards, **AI monitors the stadium**. It predicts bottlenecks before they occur, explains its reasoning, automatically dispatches volunteers, and seamlessly assists global fans in multiple languages.

**Why Generative AI?** Traditional algorithms can trigger a simple threshold alert, but Generative AI contextualizes complex, overlapping situations (e.g., "A medical alert near Gate 4 during halftime rush"), formulates mitigation plans, translates alerts instantly, and provides natural-language summaries for operators.

## 🌐 API Overview

Documented extensively in [API.md](API.md).

| Method | Route | Purpose | Expected Request | Expected Response |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/copilot/predict` | Generate AI predictions for crowd flow. | `{ crowd_density: 85 }` | `{ risk_score: 75, recommendation: "..." }` |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/dashboard/kpi` | Retrieve real-time metrics. | `None` | `{ crowdDensity: 82, volunteers: 45 }` |

## 🧠 AI Workflow

The AI workflow operates as a proactive continuous pipeline:

1. **Sensor Data** (Crowd metrics, tickets scanned)
   ↓
2. **Risk Detection** (Heuristics flag anomalies)
   ↓
3. **AI Analysis** (Gemini analyzes context and historical data)
   ↓
4. **Recommendation** (Decision engine formulates mitigation)
   ↓
5. **Volunteer Dispatch** (Tasks automatically assigned to nearest staff)
   ↓
6. **Multilingual Alerts** (PA announcements generated in required languages)
